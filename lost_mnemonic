the mnemonic phrase is no longer available. But if you have access to the server
you can get your wallet in two ways (the mnemonic phrase can no longer be returned)
1) restore the private key from the wallet
sourced keys export you_name_wallet --unarmored-hex --unsafe

And stick it in the kepler (there will be access to the wallet through the kepler)
2) save the file itself which is located $HOME/.source/
and when moving to another server
to insert it on the new server in the same directory. will have access to the wallet
